# Circuitpython-Keypad_I2C
A simple test using PCF8574 I2C IO Expander with 3x4 Matrix Keypad in Circuitpython

I am using Seeed XIAO RP2040 in a bunch of new projects, because it's small. 
Matrix Keypads, LCD Displays and other devices use a bunch of pins. So I started to use PCF8574 and PCF8575 in my projects, in order to save a few pins.
